# AbandonedBuildNet

AbandonedBuildNet is an interactive React + Next.js application that simulates the likelihood of buildings being abandoned. It allows users to adjust building health indicators and visualize how changes in these factors might influence the predicted abandonment status of a building. While the app mimics the process of a neural network, no actual machine learning model is used â€” instead, predefined rules and logic simulate the prediction process.

## Features

- Neural Network Visualization: Displays input, hidden, and output nodes in an intuitive flow.
- Interactive Controls: Users can adjust indicators like building age, maintenance score, and occupancy rate to see how they impact predictions.
- Real-Time Feedback: Provides a clear abandonment score with detailed statuses such as "Well Maintained" or "Completely Abandoned."
- Modern Design: Built with TailwindCSS for a clean, responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: React framework with server-side rendering capabilities.
- TailwindCSS: For styling and responsive design.
- TypeScript: Ensures type safety and maintainable code.

## How It Works

- Neural Network Simulation: 
  - Input indicators (e.g., Building Age, Maintenance Score) are processed using predefined rules, simulating a neural network's behavior.
  - Outputs are dynamically updated to show the probability of abandonment.
- Control Panel: 
  - Sliders allow for real-time adjustments of key metrics.
  - Immediate feedback visualizes the impact of changes on the predicted abandonment status.
